# Thanks for checking out Chat App!

Chat App is a simple, chat room-focused app, built using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/), [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/), and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

Each chat room is meant for a specific topic. Log in using your Google account and join as many conversations as you want!

This project was a collaboration between Jake Spodek and Evan Kwan.
